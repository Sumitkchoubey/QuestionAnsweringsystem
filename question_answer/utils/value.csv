Outside  the  railings  the  hollow  square  of  crumbling  houses, shells of a bygone gentry, leaned as if in ghostly gossip over  the  forgotten  doings of the vanished quality. Sic transit  gloria  urbis. A block or  two north of the  park,  dawe  steered  the  editor again  eastward,  then,  after  covering  a  short  distance,  into  a  lofty  but  narrow  flathouse  burdened  with  a  floridly  over-decorated  façade. To  the  fifth  story  they  toiled,  and  dawe,  panting,  pushed  his  latch-key into  the  door of one  of the front  flats. The  case was assigned to me.

Men of science have turned the spotlight  of truth upon the world, and this truth is rapidly freeing men and women from  this terrible fear of death. The young men and young women who attend the  colleges and universities are not easily impressed by “ﬁre” and “brimstone. ”  through the aid of biology, astronomy, geology, and other related sciences, the  fears of the dark ages which gripped the minds of men and destroyed their reason  have been dispelled. Insane asylums are ﬁlled with men and women who have gone mad, because of  the fear of death. The reason is obvious. It is little  wonder that men have become frightened at the approach of death. Some- times the fear of death is closely associated with the fear of poverty, where one’s  death would leave loved ones poverty-stricken. In other cases, the fear of death is  caused by illness and the consequent breaking down of physical body resistance.', 'prob': 0.5, 'page': [220, 219, 221]}"
